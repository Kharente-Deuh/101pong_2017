The goal of this project is to work on a 3d version of this game (or of the Brick Break game by the way...) ; only one bat
will be considered, moving only in the 0-altitude plan (which happens to be (Oxy)).

Your program have then to print :
• the coordinates of the ball speed vector,
• the ones of the ball in a given amount of time,
• the angle at which the ball will hit the bat (if ever the ball will indeed hit the bat, at anytime from t=0).
